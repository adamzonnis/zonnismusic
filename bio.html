With hundreds of shows played across Canada and Latin America, this duo promises an evening of exquisite peace, love and, above all, good times. <br> <br>
Zonnis will be packing up the RV and hitting the road this summer with advance copies their brand new full length album "Road Living". The album explores a variety of topics including societal expectations, freedom, finding truth, enlightenment, love and the flat earth theory. Both sincere and humorous, Zonnis musically brings to life stories and musings of travel, adventure and family. True to sound, "Road Living" captures the essence of two star cross lovers in search of meaning and fun.
